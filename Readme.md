This project is a simple demonstration of the power and flexibility of flexbox. It utilizes only flexbox to create the layout.

The website is also responsible with a few breakpoints set between the small screen and a large screen.

A basic javascript functionality has been implemented for the menu button and the scrolling effect is smooth.

All in all, this project is meant to demonstrate the usefulness of flex-box and how it can be used to create beautiful and dynamic website/webapp layouts.
